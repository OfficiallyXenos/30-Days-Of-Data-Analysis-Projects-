# Day 2: Data Filtering & Selection

Welcome to Day 2 of the 30-Days-Of-Data-Analysis-Projects. In this project, we focus on data filtering and selection techniques using a dataset of employee records.

## Project Overview

Data filtering and selection are fundamental steps in data analysis, allowing analysts to focus on relevant subsets of data based on specific criteria. This project demonstrates these techniques using a dataset of employee records.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `employee_records.csv`, which contains various attributes of employees, including:

- **Employee ID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **Name**: Full name of the employee.
- **Department**: Department where the employee works.
- **Position**: Job title of the employee.
- **Salary**: Annual salary of the employee.
- **Hire Date**: Date when the employee was hired.
- **Status**: Employment status.

## Objectives

- **Load and Explore Data**: Import the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand its structure and contents.
- **Filter Data**: Apply filtering techniques to extract subsets of data based on specific conditions, such as employees in a particular department or those with salaries above a certain threshold.
- **Select Data**: Choose specific columns that are relevant for analysis, omitting unnecessary information.
- **Analyze Filtered Data**: Perform basic analyses on the filtered data, such as calculating average salaries or counting employees per department.
