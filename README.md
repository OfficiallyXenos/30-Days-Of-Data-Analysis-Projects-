# 🚀 30 Days of Data Analysis Projects  

Welcome to my **30-day data analysis challenge!** This repository contains daily projects focused on **mastering data analysis with Python, pandas, and statistics**.  

## 📌 About the Challenge  
I am committing to **one project per day** for 30 days to strengthen my **data wrangling, transformation, visualization, and statistical analysis** skills. Each project builds on previous knowledge and covers different real-world domains.  

## 📅 Project Breakdown  

| Day | Project Title | Focus Area |
|----|--------------|------------|
| 1 | **Data Cleaning: Customer Transactions** | Handling missing values, duplicates, data types |
| 2 | **Employee Data Filtering & Selection** | Boolean indexing, `.query()`, `.loc[]`, `.iloc[]` |
| 3 | **Customer Data Transformation** | Feature engineering, `.apply()`, reshaping data |
| 4 | **[Upcoming]** | **Aggregation & Grouping** |
| 5 | **[Upcoming]** | **Joining & Merging Datasets** |
| ... | **More to Come!** | 📈 |
