# Optimizing Controlled Environment Agriculture with Data Analytics

## Overview
This project is part of my **30-day data analysis challenge**, focusing on **Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)**. It applies various data analysis techniques to optimize agricultural productivity in controlled environments.

## Datasets
- **CEA Sensor Data**: Logs temperature, humidity, COâ‚‚ levels, light intensity, and nutrient levels.  
- **Crop Yield Data**: Contains growth metrics, yield, and quality indicators for different crops.  
- **Environmental Control Data**: Records irrigation schedules, COâ‚‚ enrichment, and artificial lighting.  

## Key Tasks
This project covers multiple data analysis techniques:  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing, inconsistent, and duplicate sensor readings.  
- **Data Filtering & Selection**: Extracting specific environmental conditions affecting crop growth.  
- **Merging & Joining**: Integrating datasets to analyze relationships between variables.  
- **Data Aggregation**: Computing summary statistics to understand optimal farming conditions.  
- **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful charts and graphs to highlight trends.  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
